## Background:
Gomoku game project is a board game based on the popular Japanese strategy board game called Gomoku. This game is played on a 15 x 15 grid or sometimes on a 19 x 19 grid. For this project, we initially aimed for 15 x 15 but later went with 19x 19 for the game time to go longer. This game is a bigger MAP version of Tic Tac Toe except that the former requires the player to be able to create an unbroken row of five symbols whereas Tic Tac Toe is played on a 3 x 3 grid which makes sense because this one has much bigger MAP size and only requires the player to create an unbroken row of three symbols to win compared to 5 on this one. This game requires 5 symbols of “X” or ”O” to win or if there are no more moves, we  call  it  “Draw”. This game is popular in many Asian countries like Vietnam, Japan, Singapore, etc but now this game  has  also  gained  wide  popularity  all  over  the  world.  <br><br>

## Rules:
- This game is played using the X and O symbol like in tic tac toe with Player 1 being "*X*" and Player 2 being "*O*", Two players play against each other on a 19 x 19.
- Everytime Player 1 representing the “*X*” symbol gets to take the first turn followed by the player representing  the  “*O*” symbol and players take turns placing their symbol on an open intersection on the board. 
- It is strategy game, as players must race to create an unbroken row of *five symbols* while blocking their opponent to prevent them from creating five in a row. 
- The player that manages to create *five in a row first wins the round* where the row can be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal if it is unbroken.
- "Draw" is possible in this game if there are no more moves for either player to make a move.
- Think before you make move because this game seems like a small and easy game but there is a lot of thinking and strategy involved in it like forcing the opponent to place their symbol.

## Hints:
- Always have a strategy in most of the times you stick to it unless the oponent forces you to do something else. Occasionally after finding the typical move which you would play try to play new move which would refresh the game and might surprise the opponent. A good tactics would be to let the opponent attack, yet control the position until he has nowhere to build the attack.     
- Always pay a special attention and use more time on the first ten moves of the game, which mostly define the whole game. If you make a bad move the beginning of the game, you will not be able to turn it around even you if are a very good player.
- Always block the opponents four and prevent him from winning and then think and do not spend time to think what this four would change in the position. If you want to continue the game, you can think about the position after the move.
- Always check the position after opponents move and try to read his next move and do not play immediately. Even if the opponent played the move you expected, do not play your move with seconds make sure the position you counted in your head is going to be developed the same way on the board.
