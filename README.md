Background <br>
Gomoku game  project which is a board game based on the popular Japanese strategy board game called Gomoku. The game is played on a 15 x 15 grid or sometimes on a 19 x 19 grid, depending on the version. For this project, we will be aiming for 15 x 15. Gomoku is somewhat similar to Tic Tac Toe except that the former requires the player to be able to create an unbroken row of five symbols whereas Tic Tac Toe is played on a 3 x 3 grid and only requires the player to create an unbroken row of three symbols to win. This game requires 5 symbols of “X” or ”O” to win which is popular in many Asian countries, or if there are no more moves, we  call  it  “a  tie”.  Now  it  has  also  gained  wide  popularity  all  over  the  world.  <br><br>

Rules<br>
    • It is played using the X and O symbol like in tic tac toe. Two players play against each other on a 15 x 15.<br>
    • The player representing the “X” symbol gets to take the first turn followed by the player representing  the  “O” symbol. <br>
    • Players take turns placing their symbol on an open intersection on the board. <br>
    • It is strategy game, as players must race to create an unbroken row of five symbols while blocking their <br> opponent to prevent them from creating five in a row. <br>
    • The player that manages to create five in a row first wins the round. The row can be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal if it is unbroken. <br>
    • This seems like a small and easy game but there is a lot of thinking and strategy involved in it like forcing the opponent to place their symbol <br>
