## Background:
Gomoku game  project which is a board game based on the popular Japanese strategy board game called Gomoku. The game is played on a 15 x 15 grid or sometimes on a 19 x 19 grid, depending on the version. For this project, we will be aiming for 15 x 15. Gomoku is somewhat similar to Tic Tac Toe except that the former requires the player to be able to create an unbroken row of five symbols whereas Tic Tac Toe is played on a 3 x 3 grid and only requires the player to create an unbroken row of three symbols to win. This game requires 5 symbols of “X” or ”O” to win which is popular in many Asian countries, or if there are no more moves, we  call  it  “a  tie”.  Now  it  has  also  gained  wide  popularity  all  over  the  world.  <br><br>
## Technologies Used:
* Rust in Stable run with direct access to hardware and memory. <br>
- Iced version 0.3.0 cross-platform GUI library inspired by Elm which was simple, easy-to-use, batteries-included API Type-safe, reactive programming model Cross-platform       support.<br>

## Rules:
- It is played using the X and O symbol like in tic tac toe. Two players play against each other on a 15 x 15.<br><br>
- The player representing the “X” symbol gets to take the first turn followed by the player representing  the  “O” symbol. <br><br>
- Players take turns placing their symbol on an open intersection on the board. <br><br>
- It is strategy game, as players must race to create an unbroken row of five symbols while blocking their <br> opponent to prevent them from creating five in a row. <br>
- The player that manages to create five in a row first wins the round. The row can be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal if it is unbroken. <br><br>
- This seems like a small and easy game but there is a lot of thinking and strategy involved in it like forcing the opponent to place their symbol <br>
## Hints:
- Be creative. When it’s your turn, you got a first idea within seconds and in most of the times you stick to it. Occasionally after finding the typical move which you would play (especially in the beginning of corner games) try to play new move which would refresh the game and might surprise the opponent. <br><br>
- Pay a special attention and use more time on the first ten moves of the game, which mostly define the whole game. If you screw up the beginning of the game, you will not be able to save it even you if are the best player in the world.<br><br>
- Always block the opponents four and then think. Do not spend time to think what this four would change in the position. If you want to continue the game, you have only one move to play. You can think about the position after the move.<br><br>
- Always check the position after opponents’ move and do not play immediately. Even if the opponent played the move you expected, do not play your move with seconds make sure the position you counted in your head is going to be developed the same way on the board.<br><br>
- Have a plan and follow it/adjust. Set a plan before the game and stick to it. With every move you take, try to follow the plan. For example, you opponent prefers attacking only. So, the good tactics would be to let him attack, yet control the position until he has nowhere to build the attack.   <br><br>
